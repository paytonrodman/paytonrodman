# Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paytonrodman/paytonrodman/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am a data scientist with a background in physics simulations and a love for effective data communication. I believe that the data we collect, analyse, and disseminate contains a multitude of stories based on our audience’s perceptions, lived experiences, and needs. This belief underlies my approach to presentations–and information sharing more broadly–as story-telling. I am also an avid puzzler, problem-solver, and bug finder, and am always searching for new ways to improve my coding craft.

Before moving to the UK, I studied physics and applied mathematics at the University of Tasmania in Australia, where I received my Bachelors (2017) and Honours (2018) degrees. In 2024, I was awarded my PhD in Astronomy from the University of Cambridge, supported by the Gates Cambridge Scholarship.
